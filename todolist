add errors for keywords not being in uppercase
add error for repeated variable names (regardless of case)
start and end seems a bit off for undeclared error? (minor issue)
change the 1s and 0s in boolean to true and false --> add new data type for booleans
errors seem to be wrong for incorrect syntax for IF errors
seems like if comparisons don't work
add CASE statements
add steps back into for loops
add functions in and make sure they work
add repeat until
add 2D arrays
add file handling
NOT doesn't work
