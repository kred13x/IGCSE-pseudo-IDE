**IF STATEMENTS**

IF statements in IGCSE pseudocode executes certain line(s) of code if a condition is met. They are formatted as so:

	IF <condition> THEN <statement> ENDIF

Or, if you want to execute multiple statements:

	IF <condition> THEN
		<statement 1>
		<statement 2>
		<statement 3>
	ENDIF

IF statements may also include an ELSE case. The ELSE case will be executed if the condition is not met. With the ELSE statement, you can nest another IF statement inside to check multiple conditions. With these methods, you can create a program like this:

	IF grade >= 80 THEN
		OUTPUT “You got an A!”
	ENDIF
	ELSE IF grade >= 70 THEN
		OUTPUT “You got a B!”
	ENDIF
	ELSE IF grade >= 60 THEN
		OUTPUT “You got a C!”
	ENDIF
	ELSE
		OUTPUT “You failed :(“
	ENDIF
