**LOGIC EXPRESSIONS**

Logic expressions return either **TRUE** or **FALSE**. This IDE supports the following logic operators:

	AND
	OR
	NOT

The **AND** operator returns **TRUE** if expressions on either side of the operator are true. For example:

	2>1 AND 2<3

This will return **TRUE**.

	2>5 AND 2<3

This will return **FALSE**.

The **OR** operator returns **TRUE** if one of the expressions on either side of the operator is true. For example:

	1=1 OR 1>8

This will return **TRUE**, as 1=1 is TRUE even though 1>8 is **FALSE**.

The **NOT** operator reverses the **TRUE/FALSE** of the statement and is put at the front of an expression. For example:

	NOT 1=1

This will return **FALSE** as 1=1 is **TRUE** and the **NOT** operator reverses that.
