**COMPARISON EXPRESSIONS**

Comparison expressions check whether a given expression is true or false. This IDE supports the following comparison operators:

	= (equal)
	> (greater than)
	< (less than)
	>= (greater or equal than)
	<= (less or equal than)
	!= (not equal to)

Try entering this into the command line:
	
	2<5

This will output **TRUE** as 2 is less than 5!
