**USING THE COMMAND LINE**

The command line allows you to enter singular lines of code. Try entering this in the text box at the bottom of the screen:

	OUTPUT “hello world”

The command line keeps track of previous lines of code, allowing you to build up on previous lines. Try entering these three lines in this order:

	DECLARE a : INT
	a <- 10
	OUTPUT a + 3

For longer programs, though, it is recommended to use the code editor, which allows you to input multiple lines.

To delete all previous code in the command line, press the button at the top!
