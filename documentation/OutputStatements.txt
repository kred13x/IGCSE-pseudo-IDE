**OUTPUT STATEMENTS**

OUTPUT statements simply print out a given statement. They are formatted as so:

	OUTPUT <statement>

You can output simple statements, such as:

	OUTPUT 5
	OUTPUT “hello!”

You can also output arithmetic expressions, such as:

	OUTPUT 3+3
	OUTPUT “hello” + “world”

This will output the result of the expression (e.g. OUTPUT 3+3 will output 6)!

You can also output variables! Here’s a full program to demonstrate this.

	DECLARE a : INT
	a <- 5
	OUTPUT a*a

This will output 25.
